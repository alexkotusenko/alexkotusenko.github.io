            <h4 class="col-sm-8 centered">The Frequency Analysis</h4>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered">Sometimes, the arrival of a new invention makes old concepts or techniques inefficient, unsecure or obsolete. That’s the case for the substitution ciphers along with many other cryptosystems. The arrival of the frequency analysis, first developed by muslim mathematicians, significantly shook up the world of cryptography. It made most of the ciphers present at that time completely unsecure, thus marking the beginning of a very action-packed period in the history of cryptography. It made most of the ciphers present at that time pretty that were prone to being cracked wide open by this simple, yet efficient technique obsolete, separating the strong from the weak, if you will. </p>
            
            <p class="col-sm-8 centered">The thing is, some letters are used more than others in a given language. As a matter of fact, the most common letters in English are E, followed by T, A, I and so on. As the name suggests, the frequency analysis consists of taking into account the frequency of every single character in the ciphertext, and then figuring out which letter it stands for by comparing its frequency with the frequencies of letters in English.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered">Furthermore, several linguistic details are taken into account when working with frequency analysis. One should always be on the lookout for one or two letter long words to quickly associate a ciphertext symbol with a letter in the alphabet in question.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered">As you might have guessed already, it’s essential to know what language has been encrypted in order to know what frequencies you need to compare the recurrence of each letter to. Besides, a relatively large amount of text is needed to efficiently use this technique, as one phrase would be likely to not yield any helpful information.</p>
