            <h4 class="col-sm-8 centered asym">Introduction to Assymetric Cryptography</h4>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered asym">In the previous articles, I’ve touched upon the concepts of symmetric cryptography, a branch of the discipline that works in a pretty straightforward way: the parties agree upon a shared key that they’re going to encrypt and decrypt their messages with later on. However, this approach is not the best one out there when it comes to security.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered asym">That’s where <span class="italic">asymmetric cryptography</span>, also known as public key cryptography, comes in. Its main difference from the symmetric branch of cryptography is the use of two mathematically related keys instead of one: a public key and a private key. “Why do you need two keys anyways?” you might ask. Well, let me explain.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered asym">To make things as clear as possible, I’ll explain how the encryption and decryption methods work. To encode a message, a public key has to be used, whereas to decrypt one, a private one is needed. That’s why, as you may have guessed already, private keys should never be shared with anyone (not even the person you’re communicating with), while the public ones can be exchanged without taking any extra precautions given that they only allow the person who manages to lay their hands on them to encrypt a given message, but not to decrypt it.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered asym">When using public key cryptography, each party must have their own public and private key. Then, to make the communication possible, the parties involved have to exchange their public keys. Imagine a person called Alice trying to communicate with her friend Bob using asymmetric cryptography. First of all, Alice and Bob have to define their public and private keys. Once they’re done, they exchange their public keys while keeping their private ones to themselves. Whenever Bob wants to send Alice a message, he uses Alice’s public key to encrypt it. Then, once Alice gets the message, she uses her private key in order to decrypt it. Given that her public and private keys are mathematically related, she’s the only person who can decrypt a message encrypted using her public key.
