            <h4 class="col-sm-8 centered">The Vigenère Cipher</h4>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered">The history of cryptography was heavily influenced by a rat race during which many ciphers came and went, each and every one of them made obsolete by ever-evolving cipher breaking methods. The unforeseen arrival of the frequency analysis completely wiped out every possibility of secure communication and left the cipher creators paralyzed. A sudden need for a new and secure cryptosystem then arose, leaving the European world in a sticky situation.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered">The appearance of the Vigenère Cipher ended up resolving the issue in question. It's a cipher that uses the so-called polyalphabetic substitution, which I will touch upon later.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered">As a matter of fact, given that this new form of encryption was first introduced by Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553, this cipher’s name was falsely attributed to Blaise de Vigenère three centuries later, who had very little to do with this cryptosystem.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered">Unlike the other ciphers, as mentioned before, the Vigenère Cipher uses several alphabets in order to encrypt a message, hence its resistance to the frequency analysis. The key within this cipher is a word, preferably consisting of as many letters as possible. In order to encrypt or decrypt a message, the word has to be transformed into an array of numbers representing the letters’ indexes in the alphabet.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered">For example, the keyword “theta” would be transformed into the following array of integers.</p>

            <div class="table-container">
                <table class="centered">
                    <tr>
                        <th>T</th>
                        <th>H</th>
                        <th>E</th>
                        <th>T</th>
                        <th>A</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>20</td>
                        <td>8</td>
                        <td>5</td>
                        <td>20</td>
                        <td>1</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </div>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered">In order to encrypt a message one has to encrypt each letter of the plaintext using its corresponding integer in the keyword array. For example, consider the following message: “Hello World!”.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered">To encrypt the first letter of the plaintext, its index has to be shifted by its corresponding array index, i.e. 20 (T). Then, to encrypt the second letter, one has to shift its index value by the next integer in the array, i.e. 8 (H). Whenever the last index of the keyword array is used, one just has to loop right back to the first letter and do so until each letter of the plaintext is encrypted. The following process shows how to encrypt “Hello World!” using the keyword “theta”:</p>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered">The ciphertext is “<span class="bold">Bmqfp Qwwfe!</span>”.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered">In order to decrypt a message given a ciphertext and a key, one has to follow the same guidelines with one exception: one has to subtract the shift index from the original one instead of adding it.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered">Now, the beauty of this cipher is that it’s impossible to crack using the frequency analysis as long as two conditions are met:</p>

            <ol>
                <li class="col-sm-8 centered">The keyword consists of 2 or more letters (the longer the keyword is, the stronger the cipher will be)</li>

                <li class="col-sm-8 centered">The keyword consists of different letters. For example, keywords like “aaa” or “zzzzzz” should not be used.</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered">One should make sure to meet the following conditions, since using a keyword consisting of a single letter would result in a keyword array that’s only one index long and the cipher would end up being based on monoalphabetic substitution, making the whole polyalphabetic aspect of this cryptosystem obsolete.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered">Lastly, if we observe the plaintext and the ciphertext, we can see that the letter frequencies got mixed up, which made this cipher resistant to frequency analysis.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered">Plaintext: “He<span class="bold">ll</span>o World!”<br>Ciphertext: “Bmqfp Q<span class="bold">ww</span>fe!”</p>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered">As you can see, as the message was encrypted, the ciphertext version of the word “Hello” (i.e. “Bmqfp”) does not indicate the presence of any double letters, which makes one of the most important aspects of the frequency analysis unusable.</p>

            <p class="col-sm-8 centered">Also, the double “w” present in the world “Qwwfe” does not give away any plaintext details, since it stands for the “or” part of the plaintext word “World”, and using that for frequency analysis would not yield any useful information on the encryption method whatsoever.</p>
